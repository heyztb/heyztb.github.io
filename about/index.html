My name is Zach Blake and I am a software engineer from Washington state. Things are a bit on-again-off-again in terms of a formal education at the moment, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to turn that around in the near future so that I can finish pursuing a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science.
At the moment, I am working with both Golang and Python. I enjoy Golang quite a bit for it&amp;rsquo;s speed and the ability to compile and run a binary on just about any platform."

      <p>Hello World!</p>
<p>My name is Zach Blake and I am a software engineer from Washington state. Things are a bit on-again-off-again in terms of a formal education at the moment, but I&rsquo;m hoping to turn that around in the near future so that I can finish pursuing a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science.</p>
<p>At the moment, I am working with both <a href="https://golang.org">Golang</a> and <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>. I enjoy Golang quite a bit for it&rsquo;s speed and the ability to compile and run a binary on just about any platform. Over the past year or two, this has definitely been my most used language and the one I am the most comfortable in. Not too long ago I also picked up Python because I was tasked with a project that required me to build a prototype as a proof of concept, and this would&rsquo;ve taken an excessive amount of time in Golang seeing as this was more of a one off project and not something that would actually end up being used long-term. I value Python for being something I can reach for when I need to quickly hack something together, and as I&rsquo;ve done more research into the language, it turns out it has grown to become quite performant, with the advent of asyncio and libraries across the ecosystem making use of this new language feature.</p>
<p>Outside of technology, I&rsquo;m a human being. I can&rsquo;t cook very well, but I&rsquo;m trying to learn. Music is essential, and I&rsquo;m almost always listening to something to keep my mind occupied when I&rsquo;m not engaged in some other activity. Eventually I&rsquo;d love to learn music production. I have two dogs and a cat and they are an absolute handful, but fortunately I also have a truly amazing partner.</p>
<p>So, tl;dr - Golang, Python. Can&rsquo;t cook. Music is cool, animals too.</p>
